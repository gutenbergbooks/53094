<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> object of this book, as indicated in the title, is to give an
outline of the History of the English Language and Literature.</p>

<p>It aims, however, at being something more than a mere statement of
facts. It is intended to excite an interest in English philology, and in
the leading authors that from the time of Cædmon have used the English
tongue.</p>

<p>It is therefore to be regarded as an introduction to English philology
and literature; and is adapted for use in the advanced classes of
elementary schools, in secondary schools, and for pupil teachers, as
well as for private students.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-1-I" id="sect-1-I">1.</a> <b>WHAT A LANGUAGE IS.</b>&mdash;A language is a number of different sounds which
are made by the <b>tongue</b> and the other organs of speech. But a spoken
language is, or may be, written or printed upon paper by the aid of a
number of <b>signs</b> or <b>symbols</b>&mdash;which are generally printed in black ink
upon white paper.&mdash;The parts of a spoken language are called <b>sounds</b>; the
smallest parts of a written or printed language are called <b>letters</b>.&mdash;A
language is also called a <i>tongue</i> or a <i>speech</i>.&mdash;A language, like a
living being, does not remain always the same. It <i>grows</i>. As it grows,
it alters in appearance; small and great changes take place in it; and
the story of these changes is called the <i>History of the Language</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-2-I" id="sect-2-I">2.</a> <b>THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</b> is the name given to the language which is
spoken in Great Britain and Ireland, in the United States, in Canada, in
Australia and New Zealand, in South Africa, and in many other parts of
the world where Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen are found. In the
middle of the <b>fifth century</b> it was spoken by a few thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>{8}</span> men who
came over to Britain from the north-west of Europe, and by many
thousands of men and women who dwelt on the banks of the lower parts of
the great German rivers&mdash;the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Weser. It is now
spoken by more than 100 millions of people. But the English spoken in
the fifth century was a very different language from the English that is
spoken now. It was different, yet still the same. It was different in
appearance, as a child of one year old is different in looks from a man
of forty; but both the English of to-day and the English of the fifth
century are the same&mdash;because the one has grown out of the other, just
as the tall strong man of forty has grown out of the child of one year
old.</p>

<p><a name="sect-3-I" id="sect-3-I">3.</a> <b>FAMILY.</b>&mdash;To what family of languages does our English speech belong?
It belongs to the <b>Indo-European family</b> of languages. This family is so
called, because the languages which belong to it are spoken both in
India and in Europe. Many thousand years ago, the people from whom we
are descended lived on the high table-lands in the heart of Asia. Bands
of them kept travelling always farther and farther west; and it is from
their language that most of the tongues spoken in Europe are derived.
These bands left their friends and relations and country, just as young
men and women nowadays leave the homes of their parents to go and settle
in distant countries. The Indo-European is also called the Aryan family
of languages. Altogether, it embraces seven great languages&mdash;(1) The
Indian or Sanskrit; (2) Persic; (3) Greek; (4) Latin; (5) Keltic; (6)
Teutonic; and (7) Slavonic, which includes Russian, Polish, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="sect-4-I" id="sect-4-I">4.</a> <b>TEUTONS.</b>&mdash;The English language was introduced into this country by
bands of warlike colonists from Northwestern Germany, who drove the old
inhabitants to the mountainous regions in the west of the island. Those
colonists were variously called Angles, Saxons, and Jutes; but they all
belonged to the Teutonic race, and their speech was a branch of the
Teutonic group of languages. The Teutonic group of languages contains
three main sections, from which all the others spring. These three main
sections<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a>{9}</span> are: <b>High-German</b>, <b>Low-German</b>, and <b>Scandinavian</b>. High-German is
the name given to the kind of German which is spoken on the higher lands
or table-lands of South Germany&mdash;those table-lands which slope from the
Central Plain of Europe up to the Alps; and its northern boundary is the
pretty river <i>Main</i>, which falls into the Rhine. Low-German is the name
given to the kind of German spoken in the lowlands of Germany; and the
southern boundary of this kind of speech is the river Main&mdash;its northern
boundary being the Baltic and the North Sea. Scandinavian is the wide
general name given to those kinds of Teutonic speech which are found in
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. These divisions may be placed in a
table in the following manner:</p>

<p><a name="sect-5-I" id="sect-5-I">5.</a> <b>HIGH-GERMAN.</b>&mdash;High-German is spoken in the southern parts of
Germany&mdash;such as Bavaria, Swabia, and other hilly regions; and also in
the north and east of Switzerland.&mdash;It is this form of the language that
has become the book-speech or literary language of the Germans; and its
technical name is <b>New High-German</b>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-6-I" id="sect-6-I">6.</a> <b>LOW-GERMAN.</b>&mdash;The languages which belong to this division are spoken
in the plains of Germany, especially along the lower courses of the
rivers, in Holland, in part of Belgium, in England, Scotland, and
Ireland, and the British Colonies, and in the United States of North
America. The Low-German spoken in Holland is called <i>Dutch</i>; the
Low-German spoken in Belgium is called <i>Flemish</i>; the Low-German spoken
in Friesland&mdash;a wealthy province of Holland&mdash;is called <i>Frisian</i>; and
the Low-German spoken in England is called <i>English</i>. (But, as we shall
soon see, English contains many thousands of words in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>{10}</span> to those
which are purely Low-German.) The language on the continent which is
most like English is the Frisian language. There is indeed a well-known
couplet, every word in which is said to be both Frisian and English. It
runs thus:</p>

<p><a name="sect-7-I" id="sect-7-I">7.</a> <b>SCANDINAVIAN.</b>&mdash;Scandinavian is the general name given to the
different kinds of Teutonic speech which are employed in Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. The oldest and purest kind of Scandinavian
speech is that spoken in the far-off country in the middle of the North
Atlantic, called Iceland; and it is the purest, because for many
centuries there has been very little communication with that country.
Indeed, the Icelandic of the 12th century differs very little from the
Icelandic of to-day. But the English of the twelfth century differs so
much from the English of the nineteenth century, that we should at first
sight hardly know them for the same speech.&mdash;One peculiar mark of a
Scandinavian speech is the preference for hard consonants&mdash;the
preference, for example, of a <i>k</i> over a <i>ch</i> or <i>sh</i>. Thus the Danes
say <i>Dansk</i> for <i>Danish</i>; and it is Danish influence that has given to
Scotchmen and to the north of England the form <i>kirk</i> instead of
<i>church</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-8-I" id="sect-8-I">8.</a> <b>THE THREE CHIEF TEUTONIC LANGUAGES.</b>&mdash;The three most important
languages belonging to the great Teutonic stock are <b>English</b>, <b>Dutch</b>, and
<b>German</b>. If we look at the words used in these languages, we shall at
once see that they are sister-languages. If we look at the way in which
their words are changed&mdash;or at their inflections&mdash;we shall also see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>{11}</span>
that they are very closely related. Thus the commonest words appear in
these three languages in the following shape:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><b>English</b></td><td align="left">Three.</td><td align="left">Mother.</td><td align="left">Brother.</td><td align="left">Have (inf.).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><b>Dutch</b></td><td align="left">Drie.</td><td align="left">Moeder.</td><td align="left">Broeder.</td><td align="left">Hebben.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><b>German</b></td><td align="left">Drei.</td><td align="left">Mutter.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></td><td align="left">Bruder.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></td><td align="left">Haben.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">Again, the inflections of these three languages are very similar&mdash;are in
fact, different shapes of the same changes. Thus the possessive case of
nouns in all three languages ends in <b>s</b> or <b>es</b><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or <b>’s</b>. The second person
singular of verbs in all three ends in <i>st</i>; and the ending of the past
participle in all three is generally <i>en</i>. We know, then, both from
history and from a comparison of the actual facts in the present state
of the languages, that all three are sister-tongues.</p>

<p><a name="sect-9-I" id="sect-9-I">9.</a> <b>WHERE THE ENGLISH CAME FROM.</b>&mdash;Those Teutons who brought over the
English tongue to this island, came from the north-west of Europe&mdash;most
of them from that part of the German coast which lies between the river
Elbe and the river Weser. The kind of Low-German spoken by them is much
the same as that still spoken in the lowlands of Hanover, Holstein, and
Schleswig. There is in Holstein&mdash;upon the west coast&mdash;a small district
which is called <b>Angeln</b>&mdash;that is, <i>England</i>&mdash;to this day. The Teutons who
came over to Britain belonged to three tribes. They were <b>Jutes</b> and
<b>Angles</b> and <b>Saxons</b>. The Jutes came from Jutland.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Angles came from
Schleswig and Holstein. The Saxons came from Hanover and the land to the
west of it. The Jutes settled in Kent and the Isle of Wight. The Saxons
settled in Essex (or East Sex), Wessex<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (or West Sex), Sussex (or
South Sex), and Middlesex; and the ending <i>sex</i> is an indication of the
fact. The Angles settled chiefly in the north and east. One of the
kingdoms founded by them was called East Anglia; and the northern and
southern settlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>{12}</span> in it gave their names to the two counties of Norfolk
and Suffolk, which are only later forms of the words <i>North folk</i> and
<i>South folk</i>. These three tribes all spoke different dialects of the
same speech. The early predominance of the Angles, especially as the
Angles in Northumbria were the first to have a literature, gave to the
language the name of <i>English</i>, though the Keltic people still call it
<i>Saxon</i> or <i>Sassenach</i>. The country also in time acquired, from the same
cause, the name of <i>Engla-land</i>, or the <i>land of the English</i>. The first
landing of Teutons took place in the year 449; and for about a hundred
years afterwards, bands of strong young warriors and colonists continued
to arrive at short intervals.</p>

<p><a name="sect-10-I" id="sect-10-I">10.</a> <b>THE PERIODS OF ENGLISH.</b>&mdash;The language brought over to Britain by
these three tribes has grown very much since the fifth century. It has
been growing for fourteen hundred years. It has therefore altered very
much in every way; its appearance has changed; and we have to learn the
English of the fifth, or the eighth, or the eleventh century, almost as
if it were a foreign language. There are four chief periods in the
history of the English language. These are:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="rt">I.</td><td align="left">Old English, commonly called Anglo-Saxon&nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="rt">450-1100</td></tr>
<tr><td class="rt">II.</td><td align="left">Early English</td><td class="rt">1100-1250</td></tr>

<tr><td class="rt">IV.</td><td align="left">Modern English</td><td class="rt">1485-1882</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">But it must not be forgotten that there is no hard and fast line between
one period and another. A living language, like a living body, is always
changing. It takes on new additions of new matter; it loses the old.
With these new additions, its form also changes. We are rarely sensible
of these changes; but they are going on all the time for all that.</p>

<p><a name="sect-11-I" id="sect-11-I">11.</a> <b>THE OLDEST ENGLISH OR ANGLO-SAXON, 450-1100.</b>&mdash;This form of the
English language contained a very large number of inflections. The
definite article was inflected for gender, number, and case; nouns and
adjectives were highly inflected; and the verb had a very much larger
number of inflections than it has now. The words of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>{13}</span>
vocabulary during this period were almost entirely English; a few Latin
and Greek words&mdash;brought in chiefly by the church&mdash;and a few Keltic
words, had found their way into the English vocabulary. The rhyme used
in poetry was not end-rhyme, as at the present date, but head-rhyme or
alliteration&mdash;as we find it in the well-known line from Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Apt alliteration’s artful aid.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">To this period belong the writings of the poet Cædmon and of King
Alfred.</p>

<p><a name="sect-12-I" id="sect-12-I">12.</a> <b>EARLY ENGLISH, 1100-1250.</b>&mdash;The Normans had seized all power in the
state and in the church, and had held it since the year 1066. During the
early part of this period, English was not written, had ceased to be
employed in books; and French words began to creep in even among the
spoken words of the English people. The inflections of words began to
drop off, or to be carelessly used, and then to be mixed up and confused
with each other. One of the chief writers of this period is a priest
called <b>Layamon</b>, who wrote a poem called the <i>Brut</i> (<i>Brutus</i>), which
gave some account of the beginnings of the English people, who were
believed to be descended from Brutus, the fabled son of Æneas of Troy.</p>

<p><a name="sect-13-I" id="sect-13-I">13.</a> <b>MIDDLE ENGLISH, 1250-1485.</b>&mdash;Nouns and adjectives during this period
lost almost all their inflections. The inflections of verbs were very
much altered and greatly simplified.&mdash;In the year 1349, boys in school
were allowed to cease translating their Latin into French, and began to
translate it into English. In the year 1362 Edward III. passed an act of
parliament ordering the use of English in the pleadings of cases in all
courts of law, instead of Norman-French, which had hitherto been
employed. To the first half of this period belong such works as the
<i>Metrical Chronicle</i> and the <i>Lives of the Saints</i>, supposed to have
been written and translated by Robert of Gloucester; to the second half
belong the works of the great poet Chaucer, of William Langland, and of
the reformer Wicliffe.</p>

<p><a name="sect-14-I" id="sect-14-I">14.</a> <b>MODERN ENGLISH, 1485-1882.</b>&mdash;The year 1485 marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a>{14}</span> the accession of
the House of Tudor to the throne, in the person of Henry VII. By this
time almost all inflections had disappeared from our language. Many
hundreds of French words had come into the language. From the time of
the Revival of Letters<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;which may be said to have begun in the
sixteenth century&mdash;several thousands of Latin words were poured into the
English vocabulary. The period which lies between 1485 and 1603&mdash;the
year in which James I. came to the throne&mdash;is sometimes called the
period of <b>Tudor English</b>. Its greatest verse-writer is Shakspeare; its
greatest prose-writer is Hooker, who wrote <i>The Laws of Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-15-I" id="sect-15-I">15.</a> <b>ENGLISH WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</b>&mdash;The English language has for
centuries been importing words from many foreign tongues into its own
vocabulary; and it has given a hearty welcome to all kinds of strangers.
So much is this the case, and so far has this habit of taking in
strangers gone, that we can now quite accurately say: <i>Most of the words
in our English language are not English.</i> There are more Latin words in
our tongue than there are English. But this statement is true only of
our words as we find them <i>in the dictionary</i>. The words which we use
every day&mdash;the language <i>of the mouth</i>&mdash;is almost entirely English. The
<i>fixed vocabulary</i>&mdash;the vocabulary printed in the dictionary&mdash;is more
Latin than English; the <i>moving vocabulary</i>&mdash;the words which are daily
spoken&mdash;is English. Thus, if we take a passage in our translation of the
Four Gospels, we shall find from 90 to 96 per cent. of the words used
are English&mdash;and pure English. In the <i>Prologue</i> which Chaucer wrote to
his famous set of poems called <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, 88 per cent. of
the words are English; while, in Mrs Browning’s <i>Cry of the Children</i>,
the English words rise to the large proportion of 92 per cent.</p>

<p>The following is a list of a few more percentages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15"></a>{15}</span> purely English
words in the writings of well-known authors:</p>

translation of the Old Testament&mdash;and it is the oldest English version
we have&mdash;and notice what differences there are between this English and
the English of the present day. This translation was made by Abbot
Ælfric, who lived and wrote late in the tenth century. He translated
into English the five books of Moses&mdash;commonly called the
Pentateuch&mdash;Joshua, Judges, and part of the book of Job. Let us see how
he writes (Genesis, ix. 1):</p>

<p>Now every word in the above verse is modern English; but every word has
been changed&mdash;with the exception of <i>God</i>, <i>his</i>, and <i>and</i>. All the
other words have changed enormously in the course of the eight centuries
since the verse was written. The words have changed; and the grammar has
changed. The word <i>bletsian</i> has become <i>bless</i>. The grammar of the
verbs has changed enormously. For example, the imperative ending <i>ath</i>
in <i>Veahxath</i> and <i>âfyllath</i> has quite fallen away. It existed, in the
form of <i>eth</i>, down to the time of Chaucer, who writes <i>Standeth up!</i> in
addressing several persons.&mdash;Next, we ought to notice that <i>all</i> the
words are pure English. The modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a>{16}</span> version which we still use, and
which was published in 1611, has been obliged to use Latin and French
words. It says&mdash;and the words in italics are all foreign words: ‘Be
<i>fruitful</i>, and <i>multiply</i> and <i>replenish</i> the earth’! That is, it
employs three Latin words in the most important parts of the sentence.</p>

<p><a name="sect-17-I" id="sect-17-I">17.</a> <b>LOSS AND GAIN.</b>&mdash;But, while the English language has, in the course
of centuries, lost almost all its inflections, it has been all that time
gaining new words, and at the same time gaining new powers of
expression. In fact, the history of our language is a history of both
loss and gain. It has lost <i>inflections</i> and gained new <i>words</i>. An
inflected language is generally called a <b>Synthetic Language</b>, because it
expresses changes of relations by the <i>adding-on</i> (<i>synthesis</i>) of
something to the end of the word. A language which expresses relations
by little words like prepositions is called an <b>analytic language</b>. We may
therefore say that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>English was in its earlier forms a synthetic language; but it is
now an analytic language.</b></p></div>

<p>So much for the form or grammar of it. But, on the other hand, if we
look at the matter or words or vocabulary of it, we shall find that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>English was originally a pure or unmixed language; but is now an
extremely composite one.</b></p></div>

<p><a name="sect-18-I" id="sect-18-I">18.</a> <b>THE FOREIGN ELEMENTS IN ENGLISH.</b>&mdash;These have come into our language
chiefly because the English people have come so much into contact with
other peoples and tribes and nations. They came over to this island in
the fifth century, and found Kelts here; and from them they took some
Keltic words. About the end of the eighth century, the Danes came to
them; and a number of Danish words entered the language. Then another
set of Danes or Scandinavians&mdash;called Normans&mdash;came to them, conquered
them, and gave them many hundred Norman-French words. Then, with the
Revival of Letters, many scholars came over here, taught the English
people to read Greek and Latin books; and these books gave the language
several thousand words. Then the English people have always been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a>{17}</span>
greatest travellers in the world. They have gone to China and brought
home Chinese words (as well as things); they have long held India, which
has given us Hindu words; they have imported names and terms from North
and from South and Central America; they have borrowed from Spaniards
and Italians; they have taken words, nearer home, from the Dutch and
from the Germans; they have gone to the farthest east and to the
farthest west, and there is hardly a language on the face of the globe
from which they have not imported some words that live and make
themselves useful in our language.</p>

<p><a name="sect-19-I" id="sect-19-I">19.</a> <b>WELSH.</b>&mdash;When the English settled in this island, they found a people
who were called Britons, and who spoke a language called <b>British</b> or
<b>Kymric</b>. It is a language very different from English; and at first the
English warriors and the British people did not understand one single
word of what each other said. The Old English word for <i>foreigners</i> was
<i>Wealhas</i>&mdash;or, as we call it now, <i>Welsh</i>; and the English fighting men
who came over called the British people, not by the name which they
themselves used, but simply the <i>foreigners</i>&mdash;the <i>Welsh</i>. In the same
way, a German to this day calls an Italian or a Frenchman a <i>Welshman</i>;
and he calls France or Italy <i>Welshland</i>. The language spoken by the
Welsh belongs to the <b>Keltic group</b> of languages. This group contains also
<b>Erse</b>, which is spoken in the west of Ireland; <b>Manx</b>, which is spoken in
the Isle of Man; <b>Gaelic</b>, which is spoken in the Highlands of Scotland;
and <b>Breton</b>, which is spoken in Brittany&mdash;a mountainous and rugged
peninsula in the north-west of France. It at one time embraced also
<b>Cornish</b>&mdash;the language spoken in Cornwall, which was also called <i>West
Wales</i>. But that language died out in 1778; and it is not now spoken by
any one. The following is a table of the Keltic group:</p>

<p><a name="sect-20-I" id="sect-20-I">20.</a> <b>THE KELTIC ELEMENT.</b>&mdash;The words given to the English language by the
Kelts are of two kinds:</p>

<p class="indd">(i) Names of mountains, rivers, lakes, and other natural features;</p>

<p class="indd">(ii) Names of common things, which the English picked up in their
daily intercourse with the British or Welsh.</p>

<p>(i) The Keltic name for a mountain is <i>Pen</i>&mdash;a word which we find in
<i>Pennine</i> and <i>Apennine</i>. The Gaelic or Scotch Keltic form of the word
is <i>Ben</i>. Thus we have <i>Ben More</i>&mdash;which means the <i>Big Mountain</i>&mdash;<i>Ben
Nevis</i>, and many others. The commonest Keltic word for a river is
<i>Avon</i>. There are fourteen Avons in Great Britain. <i>Esk</i> is another
common Keltic name for a river; and there are eight <i>Esks</i> in Scotland
alone. In England the name takes the form of <i>Ex</i> or <i>Exe</i> (the
consonants having changed places, <i>Ex</i> = <i>Eks</i>). The name appears as
<i>Ex</i> in <i>Exeter</i> (the old form was <i>Exanceaster</i>)&mdash;that is, <i>the camp on
the Ex</i>; as <i>Ax</i> in <i>Axminster</i>; as <i>Ox</i> in <i>Oxford</i>; as <i>Ux</i> in
<i>Uxbridge</i>; as <i>Usk</i>, in Wales; and even as <i>Ouse</i>, in Yorkshire and
other counties.&mdash;<i>Aber</i> is a Keltic word which means <i>the mouth of a
river</i>; and we find it in <i>Aberdeen</i> (the town at the mouth of the Dee);
<i>Arbroath</i>, which is = <i>Aberbrothock</i>; <i>Aberystwith</i>; <i>Berwick</i>&mdash;the old
form of which was <i>Aberwick</i>. <i>Berwick</i> accordingly means the <i>wick</i> or
town at the mouth of the Tweed. <i>Car</i> or <i>Caer</i> is the Keltic word for
<i>castle</i> or <i>stronghold</i>; and we find this name in <i>Carlisle</i>,
<i>Cardiff</i>, <i>Caernarvon</i>, and others.</p>

<p>(ii) The names of common things which we have received from the Kelts
are&mdash;<i>basket</i>, <i>bran</i>, <i>cradle</i>, <i>crockery</i>, <i>clout</i>, <i>cuts</i> (= <i>lots</i>),
<i>darn</i>. Such words as <i>button</i>, <i>ribbon</i>, <i>barrel</i>, <i>car</i>, and <i>cart</i>,
are also Keltic, but have come into the English language through the
Norman-French, who received them from the descendants of the ancient
Gauls. Some Keltic words have come to us from Scotland&mdash;such as <i>pony</i>,
<i>clan</i>, <i>whisky</i>, <i>claymore</i> (a kind of sword), <i>pibroch</i>, and <i>plaid</i>;
and it is chiefly to Sir Walter Scott’s writings that we owe the common
use of these words. Ireland has also sent us a few Keltic words, such as
<i>Tory</i>, <i>brogue</i>, and <i>shamrock</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-21-I" id="sect-21-I">21.</a> <b>THE LATIN ELEMENT OF THE FIRST PERIOD</b> (i).&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a>{19}</span> Roman power, as is
generally known, was settled in Britain from the year 43 till the year
410. In the beginning of the year 410, the very existence of the Roman
Empire was threatened by the Goths and other warlike peoples; and the
Roman forces were withdrawn to defend the very heart of the empire. The
Romans, though conquerors, were true benefactors. They gave the Britons
good laws; cut roads for them through the island; established camps;
built forts and strongholds; dug harbours or ports; and planted military
settlements&mdash;which they called <i>colonies</i>&mdash;here and there among the
conquered people. When the Romans went away, they left these important
benefits behind them; and, with the things themselves, the words also
remained. But they left only six words behind them, and all of these
have combined themselves, or gone into composition, with words that are
purely English. The following are the six words: <b>Castra</b>, a <i>camp</i>;
<b>Strata</b> (<i>via</i>), a <i>paved road</i>; <b>Vallum</b>, a <i>rampart</i>; <b>Fossa</b>, a <i>ditch</i>;
<b>Colonia</b>, a <i>settlement</i>; and <b>Portus</b>, a <i>harbour</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-22-I" id="sect-22-I">22.</a> <b>THE LATIN ELEMENT OF THE FIRST PERIOD</b> (ii).&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The Latin word
<b>Castra</b> has become <i>chester</i>, <i>caster</i>, <i>cester</i>, and even <i>ter</i> (in
<i>Exeter</i>). We generally find it in the form of <i>chester</i> in the south
and west; <i>cester</i> in the middle; and <i>caster</i> in the north and east of
England. Thus we have Chester, Manchester, and Winchester in the west
and south; Leicester and Towcester in mid-England; and Tadcaster,
Doncaster, and Lancaster in the north.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Strata.</b>&mdash;The Romans drove a strongly-built military road from the
south-east to the north-west of the island&mdash;from <b>Richborough</b>, near
Dover, up to the standing camp on the river Dee, which is now called
<b>Chester</b>. This was <i>the</i> <b>Strata</b> or <b>Street</b>. It was afterwards carried
farther north, and even into Scotland. It went right over the crest of a
hill in Westmoreland, which is called <b>High Street</b> to this day. We can
trace the path of this great military road by the names of the towns and
villages that are strung upon it. Thus there are <b>Streat</b>ham (near
London), <b>Stret</b>ton, <b>Strat</b>ford-on-Avon, Stony <b>Strat</b>ford, <b>Stret</b>ford (near
Manchester), <b>Strad</b>broke, and many others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a>{20}</span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Vallum</b> is found in <i>wall</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <b>Fossa</b> is found in the names <i>Fossway</i>, <i>Fosbrooke</i>, <i>Fosbridge</i>,
and others.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <b>Colonia</b> is found in <i>Colne</i>, <i>Colchester</i>, <i>Lincoln</i>, and others.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <b>Portus</b> appears in <i>Portsmouth</i>, <i>Portsea</i>, <i>Bridport</i>, and some
other names.</p>

<p><a name="sect-23-I" id="sect-23-I">23.</a> <b>THE LATIN ELEMENT OF THE SECOND PERIOD</b> (i).&mdash;This element was not
introduced by the Romans themselves, but by Christian missionaries who
came from Rome, sent by Pope Gregory the Great to convert, not the
Britons, but the English, to Christianity. A band of forty monks, with
St Augustine at their head, landed in Kent in the year 597. For four
centuries from this date a large number of Latin words came into the
English language, chiefly words relating to the church and church
observances.</p>

<p><b>Church Terms.</b>&mdash;<i>Calic</i>, from <i>calix</i>, a cup; <i>cluster</i>, from
<i>claustrum</i>, a closed place; <i>priest</i>, from <i>presbyter</i>, an elder;
<i>sanct</i>, from <i>sanctus</i>, a holy man; <i>sacrament</i>, from <i>sacramentum</i>, a
sacred oath; <i>predician</i>, from <i>prædicare</i>, to declare; <i>regul</i>, from
<i>regula</i>, a straight piece of wood. But the old form of most of these
words has disappeared, to make room for Norman-French forms from the
same Latin source. Along with these were adopted a few Greek words&mdash;such
as <i>bishop</i>, from <i>episkopos</i>, an overseer; <i>angel</i>, from <i>anggelos</i>, a
messenger; <i>apostle</i>, from <i>apostolos</i>, a person sent; <i>monk</i>, from
<i>monăchos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a person who lives alone; and a few others.</p>

<p><a name="sect-24-I" id="sect-24-I">24.</a> <b>THE LATIN ELEMENT OF THE SECOND PERIOD</b> (ii).&mdash;The introduction of
Christianity proved to be the beginning of an intercourse with Rome,
Italys, and the Continent; and this intercourse brought with it
commerce. Commerce imported many new things; and the names of these
things came into the island along with the things themselves. Thus we
have <i>butter</i> from <i>butŷrum</i>; <i>cheese</i> from <i>caseus</i>; and <i>tunic</i> from
<i>tunica</i>. We have also <i>fig</i> from <i>ficus</i>; <i>pear</i> from <i>pirum</i>;
<i>lettuce</i> from <i>lactuca</i>, which itself comes from <i>lac</i>&mdash;milk (and hence
means <i>the milky plant</i>); and <i>pease</i> from <i>pisum</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a>{21}</span> (<i>Pease</i> is really
the singular; and <i>pea</i> is a false singular&mdash;not a plural.) We have also
from the same source some names of animals. Such are <i>camel</i> from
<i>camēlus</i>; <i>lion</i> from <i>leo</i>; <i>oyster</i> from <i>ostrea</i>; <i>trout</i> from
<i>trutta</i>. A few miscellaneous words have also come to us from this
quarter&mdash;such as <i>pound</i> from the Latin <i>pondus</i>, a weight; <i>candle</i>
from <i>candēla</i>; and <i>table</i> from <i>tabŭla</i>. The Latin word <i>uncia</i>, which
means the twelfth part of anything, is, as it were, split up into
two&mdash;and gives the two words <i>inch</i> and <i>ounce</i>, which are fundamentally
but two forms of one word. (But with regard to this class of words also
it should be observed that the words directly introduced from the Latin
have either been greatly changed in form; or they have been subsequently
borrowed again from the French.)</p>

<p><a name="sect-25-I" id="sect-25-I">25.</a> <b>THE SCANDINAVIAN ELEMENT</b> (i).&mdash;In the year 787, the Northmen,
Norsemen, or Normans of Scandinavia, began to make descents on the east
coast of England. These attacks were so dreaded by the English that
prayers were regularly used in the churches against them; and a part of
the Litany of the time contained the utterance: ‘From the incursions of
the Normans, good Lord, deliver us!’ These attacks went on for three
centuries. In the ninth century, these Danes obtained a permanent
footing in the northern and eastern parts of England; and by the
eleventh century they had become so strong that Danish kings sat upon
the throne of England from 1016 to 1042. These Norsemen were Teutons.
They were Teutons who had migrated to the north. As northern people
generally do, they preferred hard sounds to aspirates. They preferred a
<i>k</i> to a <i>ch</i>; a <i>p</i> to an <i>f</i>. The probable reason is that, in the cold
mists of the north, they had learned not to open too much their mouths
and throats; and thus they formed the habit of using a shut sound like
<i>k</i> to a sound like <i>ch</i> (in <i>loch</i>), which requires a stream of air to
be passed through the throat. We must not forget that it was the
<i>spoken</i> language of England that was affected by the Danes; not the
<i>written</i> language; for the simple reason that, in these times, not more
than one man in a thousand&mdash;either among Danes or Englishmen&mdash;could read
and write.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a>{22}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-26-I" id="sect-26-I">26.</a> <b>THE SCANDINAVIAN ELEMENT</b> (ii).&mdash;The Danish contribution is, like the
Keltic, of two kinds: (<i>a</i>) Names of places; and (<i>b</i>) Common words.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The most remarkable example of the place-name is the noun <i>by</i>,
which means <i>town</i>. There are in England more than six hundred names
ending in <i>by</i>. Almost all of these lie to the north and east of Watling
Street; to the south of it, there is scarcely one. Thus we have
<i>Whitby</i>, the <i>White Town</i>; <i>Tenby</i>, in Wales, <i>Dane’s town</i>; and
<i>Grimsby</i>, <i>the town of Grim</i>. We find the word <i>by</i> also in the
compound <i>by-law</i>. The following words are also derived from the Danes:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="hang"><b>Thorpe</b>, a village (<i>Drup</i> in Jutland, where<br /> there are scores of<br /> towns with this ending.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="hang" valign="bottom">Althorpe (old); Bishopsthorpe; Burnham-Thorpe<br /> (where Nelson was born).</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td class="hang"><b>Ness</b>, a nose or cape</td><td class="hang">Sheerness, Caithness, Fife Ness; the Naze (in Essex, etc.).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To the Norsemen we also owe the words <i>are</i>, which pushed out the
pure English <i>syndon</i>; <i>talk</i>; <i>tarn</i>; <i>busk</i> (dress); <i>sky</i>;
<i>hustings</i>; <i>fellow</i>; <i>odd</i>; <i>blunt</i>; <i>kid</i>; and many more.</p>

<p><a name="sect-27-I" id="sect-27-I">27.</a> <b>THE SCANDINAVIAN ELEMENT</b> (iii).&mdash;One result of this mixture of Danes
with Englishmen was that both, in trying to speak the language or to use
the words of each other, would naturally take firm hold of the <i>root</i> of
the word, and allow the inflections to take care of themselves. Hence
English words would lose their inflections; and this process, after it
had once begun, would go on at an increased speed, the greater became
the communication at church and at market between the English and the
Danes. The same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23"></a>{23}</span> process is now going on in the United States. Thousands
upon thousands of Germans have settled there among an English-speaking
people. These Germans are rapidly falling into the habit of using their
German words without inflections at all.</p>

<p><a name="sect-28-I" id="sect-28-I">28.</a> <b>LATIN ELEMENT OF THE THIRD PERIOD</b> (i).&mdash;This element is really
Norman-French. French is Latin, with many of the inflections lost or
changed, and with the pronunciation of the vowel-sounds enormously
altered. But it did not come from the written Latin of books; but from
the spoken Latin of soldiers and country-people (the <i>lingua Romana
rustica</i>). Norman-French is the French spoken by the Normans, who lost
their own Norsk or Danish speech, and learned French from their French
wives and children. In the year 912, the Normans, under Duke Rolf or
Rollo, wrested from King Charles the Simple the beautiful valley of the
Seine, which was afterwards called by the name of Normandy.
Norman-French was a dialect of French, and it differed in many respects
from the French spoken in the other parts of France. This Norman-French
was introduced into England as a court language by Edward the Confessor,
in the year 1042; but it was brought into this country as a folk-speech
by bands of Norman-French under the leadership of Duke William, the
seventh Duke of Normandy, in the famous year 1066. This Norman-French,
which they brought with them, became in England the language of the
ruling classes, of the court, of the lawyers, and of all priests high in
the ranks of the church. Books ceased to be written in English; boys
translated their Latin into French; an English churl had to employ a
lawyer who used only French in his law-papers and his pleadings; and
even ‘uplandish’ or country people tried ‘to speak Frensch, for to be
more ytold of.’ The saturation of English with French words probably
reached its highest point at the end of the fourteenth century; and
about that time a reaction set in. As has been before pointed out, in
1349, boys were allowed to translate their Latin into English; in 1362,
Edward III. passed an act of parliament to authorise the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24"></a>{24}</span> of English
in courts of law; and even the Normans who lived in London had begun to
use English in their families. But, by the time French had ceased to be
the language of the upper classes, several thousand French words had
found their way into our vocabulary, which had become to a large extent
<i>bilingual</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><a name="sect-29-I" id="sect-29-I">29.</a> <b>NORMAN-FRENCH</b> (ii).&mdash;The words which have been introduced into our
pure English speech from the Normans fall easily into classes.</p>

the name for the <i>open</i> hunting-ground as contrasted with the inclosed
space called a park.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a>{25}</span><i>Leveret</i>, a young hare, from the Fr. <i>lièvre</i>;
from the Lat. <i>lepus</i> (<i>-oris</i>).&mdash;<i>Quarry</i> comes from the Lat. <i>cor</i>,
the heart, and at first meant the heart and intestines, which were
thrown to the dogs who hunted down the wild beast. Milton has the
phrase, ‘scents his quarry from afar.’&mdash;<i>Couple</i> comes from the Lat.
<i>copula</i>, a band.&mdash;<i>Venison</i> means <i>hunted flesh</i>, and comes from the

<p>The Saxon hind had the charge of the cattle and animals on the farm
while they were alive; but he never saw anything of them after they were
killed. He never met them at dinner. The flesh of these animals received
French names from the Norman-Frenchmen who ate them; and their Saxon or
English names were forgotten. A German says <i>calf’s flesh</i>, but we use
the Norman-French word <i>veal</i>. Thus the corresponding English words to
those printed above are <i>ox</i>, <i>calf</i>, <i>swine</i>, <i>sheep</i>, and <i>fowl</i>. The
word <i>beef</i> comes from the Fr. <i>bœuf</i>, which comes from the Lat. <i>bos</i>
(acc. <i>bovem</i>), an ox.&mdash;<i>Veal</i> comes from the old French word <i>veel</i>,
which comes from the Lat. <i>vitellus</i>, a little calf.&mdash;<i>Pork</i> comes from
Fr. <i>porc</i>, which is derived from the Lat. <i>porcus</i>, a pig.&mdash;<i>Mutton</i>
comes from the Fr. <i>mouton</i>, from the Low Latin word <i>multo</i>, a
sheep.&mdash;<i>Pullet</i> comes from Fr. <i>poulet</i>, which comes from the Low Latin
word <i>pulla</i>, a hen.</p>

<p>The word <i>chancellor</i> comes from the Fr. <i>chancelier</i>; from the Lat.
<i>cancellarius</i>, the keeper of written papers. ‘The officer who had the
care of the records stood behind the screen of lattice-work or of
cross-bars which fenced off the judgment-seat.’ <i>Cancer</i> is the Latin
name for a crab; <i>cancellus</i> is a little crab; <i>cancelli</i> are cross-bars
or lattice-work, like the claws of crabs crossed. Hence also to
<i>cancel</i>, which means to draw cross strokes through writing.&mdash;<i>Judge</i>
comes from the French word <i>juge</i>, which comes from the Lat. <i>judex</i> (=
<i>jus-dic-s</i>, a sayer of right). The old English term was <i>dempster</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26"></a>{26}</span>
from the verb <i>deem</i>; noun, <i>doom</i>.&mdash;<i>Parliament</i> comes from the Fr.
<i>parler</i>, to speak; from Low Lat. <i>parabolāre</i>, to talk; whence also
<i>parlour</i>, a room for speaking in.&mdash;<i>Court</i> comes from the old Fr.
<i>cort</i>; from Lat. <i>cohors</i> or <i>cors</i>, an inclosed space. A <i>cohors</i> was
a sheep-pen; but it was afterwards applied to a number of
soldiers.&mdash;<i>Assize</i> comes from the old Fr. <i>assise</i>, an assembly of
judges; from the Lat. <i>assidēre</i>, to sit beside.&mdash;<i>Sue</i> comes from the
old Fr. <i>suir</i> (modern Fr. <i>suivre</i>); from the Lat. <i>sequi</i>, to follow.
We have from the same root the words <i>suit</i>, <i>suite</i>, <i>pursue</i>, <i>ensue</i>,
<i>issue</i>.&mdash;<i>Damages</i>, from the old Fr. <i>damáge</i>, which comes from the Low
Lat. <i>damnaticum</i>, harm; which comes from the Lat. <i>damnum</i>, loss.</p>

<p><i>Friar</i> is a word which comes from the old Fr. <i>freire</i>, which is
derived from the Lat. <i>frater</i>, a brother.&mdash;<i>Relic</i>, chiefly used in the
plural, from Fr. <i>reliques</i>; from Lat. <i>reliquiæ</i>, remains.&mdash;<i>Tonsure</i>

a number of synonyms.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> These have enabled us to give a different

clergy-man; of the <i>bloom</i> on a peach, and the <i>flower</i> of a lily; of a
person as a <i>member</i> of a learned society, but not a <i>limb</i>. Now
<i>blessing</i>, <i>bloom</i>, and <i>limb</i> are all English; <i>benediction</i>,
<i>flower</i>, and <i>member</i> are all Latin words&mdash;Latin words which have come
to us through the doorway of the French language. The following are some
more of these synonyms; and, after examining them, it will generally be
found that the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27"></a>{27}</span> words are stronger, simpler, and more homely
than the French words.</p>

<p><a name="sect-35-I" id="sect-35-I">35.</a> <b>BILINGUALISM.</b>&mdash;During the three centuries which lay between 1066 and
1362, the English and the Normans had to meet each other constantly in
the field, in the church, at markets, and in towns and villages. They
had to buy and sell from each other; to give and take orders from and to
each other; and to speak with each other on many kinds of business. They
also intermarried. Thus the Norman got slowly into the habit of joining
an English word with his French word&mdash;so as to make it clear to the
Englishman; while the Englishman, on his side, joined the corresponding
French word&mdash;when he happened to know it&mdash;to the English word he had to
employ. These words, ever after, ran in couples; and this habit of going
in couples became a habit of the language. Hence it is that, in the
opening words of our Prayer-Book, we use such couples as <i>assemble</i> and
<i>meet together</i>; <i>acknowledge</i> and <i>confess</i>; <i>dissemble</i> and <i>cloak</i>;
and <i>humble</i> and <i>lowly</i>. The words <i>meet together</i>, <i>acknowledge</i>,
<i>cloak</i>, and <i>lowly</i>, represent the purely English part of the
congregation; while the Norman-French supplies such words as <i>assemble</i>,
<i>confess</i>, <i>dissemble</i>, and <i>humble</i>. The great poet of the fourteenth
century&mdash;Chaucer&mdash;has hundreds of examples of such phrases. He gives us,
for example, <i>hunting</i> and <i>venerye</i>; <i>mirth</i> and <i>jollity</i>; <i>care</i> and
<i>heed</i>; <i>swinke</i> and <i>labour</i>; <i>pray</i> and <i>beseech</i>; a <i>wright</i> and
<i>carpenter</i>. The practice of using these pairs of words has very greatly
diminished in our day; but a few examples still keep their place in the
language. Such are <i>will and testament</i>, <i>use and wont</i>, <i>aid and abet</i>,
and several others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28"></a>{28}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-36-I" id="sect-36-I">36.</a> <b>DOUBLETS.</b>&mdash;It is chiefly to the same Norman-French influence that we
owe a minor phenomenon of the language&mdash;the appearance of two forms of
the same word. These two forms are called <b>doublets</b>. The Norman-French
could not pronounce our semi-vowel <i>w</i>. They had either to make a <i>v</i> of
it, or a hard <i>g</i>. They preferred the hard <i>g</i>; and, to keep it hard,
they added a <i>u</i>. Thus, for <i>wile</i>, they said <i>guile</i>; for <i>wise</i> (=
<i>manner</i>), they said <i>guise</i>; for <i>ward</i>, <i>guard</i>; for <i>warden</i>,
<i>guardian</i>; for <i>wardrobe</i>, <i>garderobe</i>; for <i>warrant</i>, <i>guarantee</i>; and
so on.</p>

<p><a name="sect-37-I" id="sect-37-I">37.</a> <b>DOUBLETS FROM DIALECTS AND OTHER SOURCES.</b>&mdash;Besides the doublets due
to Norman-French influences, there are many interesting cases which may
be referred to. Some are evidently due to differences of dialect. The
English language grew up from different centres, which had little or no
connection with each other, on account of the difficulties of
travelling. Hence a word would take different forms in different
dialects&mdash;like <i>church</i> in the south of the English-speaking country,
and <i>kirk</i> in the north; so also with <i>cole</i>, of which the northern form
is <i>kail</i>. Sometimes one word is merely a later and modified form of
another, as <i>draw</i> of <i>drag</i>. In all cases doublets are forms of the
same word, which have come through different experiences of place, or
time, or other influence. In short, they should be recognised as really
one word, with a difference in spelling and meaning, resulting from its
history. Other specimens of doublets are <i>down</i> and <i>dune</i>; <i>shriek</i> and
<i>screech</i>; <i>shell</i> and <i>scale</i>; <i>wagon</i> and <i>wain</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-38-I" id="sect-38-I">38.</a> <b>PRONUNCIATION.</b>&mdash;The Norman-French refined our mode of speaking; made
the existing vowel-sounds less coarse; gave us some new vowel-sounds;
and, above all, taught us to give up most of our rough throat-sounds or
gutturals. They gradually turned out the gutturals from the beginning of
words; and <i>genoh</i> became <i>enough</i>, and <i>gif</i>, <i>if</i>. They turned them
out of the middle of words; and <i>nagel</i> became <i>nail</i>, and <i>hagel</i>,
<i>hail</i>. They got rid of them at the ends of words; and we no longer
pronounce the guttural in <i>flight</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>right</i>, and <i>sight</i>. This
is all the more absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29"></a>{29}</span> and remarkable that we write <i>the sound that
once was there</i> with two strong gutturals, <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>. Sometimes the
influence of the Norman-French was to turn the guttural into a kind of
hissing sound or sibilant; and it is in this way that we came to say
<i>teach</i>, <i>beseech</i>, and <i>catch</i>. But the <i>ch</i> in these words comes back
to its older use, and becomes a <i>gh</i> again, in the past tense&mdash;in
<i>taught</i>, <i>besought</i>, and <i>caught</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-39-I" id="sect-39-I">39.</a> <b>LATIN OF THE FOURTH PERIOD.</b>&mdash;The Latin introduced into our language
by the Norman-French was a <i>spoken</i> Latin. It was the Latin of the <i>ear
and mouth</i>. It was the everyday speech of the people; and underwent very
great change. The Latin introduced into our language by learned men was
a <i>written</i> or <i>printed</i> Latin. It was the Latin of <i>the eye and pen</i>.
This Latin is called the <i>Latin of the Fourth Period</i>; and it was
brought into our language by a powerful movement known as the <b>Revival of
Learning</b>.&mdash;When the Turks took Constantinople in 1453, the learned
Greeks of that capital fled from the city, carrying with them their
precious manuscript copies of Greek and Latin writers. They fled into
Italy, into Germany, and into France and England. They taught Greek and
Latin in the universities of these countries; and very soon the study of
Greek and Latin became the fashion among all persons of leisure; and the
stores of thought and beauty in Homer and Sophocles, in Virgil and
Horace, were diligently studied and appropriated. Queen Elizabeth was a
good Greek scholar, and could both speak and write good Latin. Now began
to come into our language thousands of Latin words; until, in the
beginning of the seventeenth century, an eminent writer complains that
Englishmen will have ‘to learn Latin to understand English, and a work
will prove of equal facility in either.’ Unlike the Latin words of the
Third Period, the Latin words introduced in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries suffered little or no change. They were
transferred from Latin books just as they were&mdash;by the accurate aid of
the hand and eye, and underwent no process of change or corruption. The
Latin <i>opinio</i> became <i>opinion</i>; <i>notio</i>, <i>notion</i>; <i>suggestio</i>,
<i>suggestion</i>; <i>separatum</i>, <i>separate</i>; <i>iteratum</i>, <i>iterate</i>; and so on.
It would be a great mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a>{30}</span> however, to suppose that all the Latin of
this <i>Fourth Period</i> came <i>directly</i> from the Latin. Most of it came
through the medium of French, as did the Latin of the <i>Third Period</i>;
but unlike it, it was not the language of the people. In French, as in
English, it was the language merely of books, of the literary and of
learned men.&mdash;It is worthy of notice that many words which we use every
day, and which we think must <i>always</i> have been in the language, only
came in about this period, and are therefore comparatively new. Thus Mr
Gill, the high-master of St Paul’s School in 1619, and the teacher of
John Milton in his boyhood, complains of the introduction of words which
are now quite common to all of us. He says: ‘O harsh lips! I now hear
all around me such words as <i>common</i>, <i>vices</i>, <i>envy</i>, <i>malice</i>; even
<i>virtue</i>, <i>study</i>, <i>justice</i>, <i>pity</i>, <i>mercy</i>, <i>compassion</i>, <i>profit</i>,
<i>commodity</i>, <i>colour</i>, <i>grace</i>, <i>favour</i>, <i>acceptance</i>.’ The wonder
nowadays would be how we could possibly get on without these words, and
how we could ever have done without them.</p>

<p><a name="sect-40-I" id="sect-40-I">40.</a> <b>MOUTH LATIN AND BOOK LATIN.</b>&mdash;The introduction of Latin words into
our English speech by two doors&mdash;by the living conversation of living
people, and by the silent door of books, has given rise to a phenomenon
of the same kind as that described in section 36. But the phenomenon of
duplicates or <b>doublets</b> presents itself to our notice on a much larger
scale now; and, in every case, the duplicate word becomes in reality two
separate words&mdash;employed for separate purposes, and with perfectly
distinct meanings. Thus, though <i>legal</i>, <i>leal</i>, and <i>loyal</i> are, in
their origin, fundamentally the same word, their meanings are perfectly
distinct and even widely different; <i>hospital</i> and <i>hotel</i> are the same
words, but they are no longer used in the same sense; while <i>fact</i> and
<i>feat</i> have also widely diverged from each other in use and in
signification. The Latin words that have come from the Latin language by
the path of books, have kept their Latin shape, and may be called <i>Book
Latin</i>. The Latin words that have come to us by the path of
Norman-French have undergone great alterations; and they may be called
<i>spoken Latin</i>. The chief process of alteration<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a>{31}</span> undergone by them is
that of <i>squeezing</i>; three syllables have generally been squeezed into
two. The following is a list:</p>

and <i>castles</i>, and <i>attempted</i> to <i>introduce</i> new <i>terms</i>. The
<i>universe</i> and the <i>firmament</i>&mdash;the <i>planets</i>, <i>comets</i>, and
<i>meteors</i>&mdash;the <i>atmosphere</i> and the <i>seasons</i>, all were <i>impressed</i> with
the <i>seal</i> of the <i>conqueror</i>. Hills became <i>mountains</i>, and dales
<i>valleys</i>; streams were called <i>rivers</i>, and brooks <i>rivulets</i>;
waterfalls, <i>cascades</i>; and woods, <i>forests</i>.’</p>

<p>All the words in italics in the above passage are either of Latin or of
French origin; if of French, then they are Latin at second-hand.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) ‘But the <i>dominion</i> of the Norman did not <i>extend</i> to the home of
the Englishman, it stopped at the threshold of his house; there, around

his beloved kindred; the bride, the wife, and the husband, sons and
daughters, brothers and sisters, tied to each other by love, friendship,
and kind feelings, knew nothing dearer than their own sweet home.’</p>

<p>Only one word in the above is French (<i>dominion</i>), and two are Latin
(<i>extend</i> and <i>kitchen</i>). All the others are purely English.</p>

<p><a name="sect-43-I" id="sect-43-I">43.</a> <b>ENGLISH WORDS LOST.</b>&mdash;The copious introduction of Norman-French,
Latin, and Greek terms into our language, had the effect of pushing a
great number of purely English words <i>out</i> of our speech, or at least of
making them less frequent in use. Thus we used to say <i>fore-elders</i>, but
this word has had its place taken by <i>ancestors</i>; <i>fairhood</i> has been
pushed out by <i>beauty</i>; and <i>wonstead</i> by <i>residence</i>. In the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a>{34}</span> way,
<i>forewit</i> has given place to <i>caution</i>; <i>licherest</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to <i>cemetery</i>;
<i>inwit</i> to <i>conscience</i>; <i>bookhoard</i> to <i>library</i>; and <i>hindersome</i> to
<i>obstructive</i>. In fact, it is often easier for us to understand foreign
words than those of our own native home-grown speech. The title of an
old book written in the thirteenth century is the <i>Ayenbite<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of
Inwyt</i>&mdash;a title which is to us much more intelligible in its
Franco-Latin translation of <i>Remorse of Conscience</i>. Mr Barnes, the
Dorsetshire poet, has tried to re-introduce the genuine homely English
way of speaking and writing; and to banish Latin terms. Thus, in his
<i>Grammar</i> or ‘Book of Speech-Craft,’ he calls <i>singular</i>, <i>onely</i>;
<i>plural</i>, <i>somely</i>; and he calls <i>degrees of comparison</i>, <i>pitches of
suchness</i>. The difficulty he has to contend with is, that this home
English is less intelligible to our modern ears than the foreign Latin.
Thus the following sentence looks like a word-puzzle: ‘These pitch-marks
off mark sundry things by their sundry suchnesses, as, “The <i>taller</i> or
<i>less tall</i> man of the two is my friend.”<span class="lftspc">’</span> And he also says&mdash;what is a
useful warning for us: ‘Speech was shapen of the breath-sounds of
speakers, for the ears of hearers; and not from speech-tokens (letters)
in books, for men’s eyes.’</p>

<b>The History of the Grammar of English.</b></h2>

<p><a name="sect-1-II" id="sect-1-II">1.</a> <b>AN INFLECTED LANGUAGE.</b>&mdash;When, in the fifth century, our English
speech was brought over from the Continent, it was a highly inflected or
<b>Synthetic</b> language; and it remained in this condition for several
centuries. The coming of the Danes had the effect of beginning the
dropping off of inflections. The coming of the Normans extended very
much and hastened this process, which has gone on with considerable
rapidity down to the present day. We may put the general fact in this
way:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a>{35}</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">The English Language was a <b>Synthetic Language</b> down to about the
year 1100; since that time, it has been becoming more and more of
an <b>Analytic Language</b>.</p></div>

<p><a name="sect-2-II" id="sect-2-II">2.</a> <b>THE GRAMMAR OF NOUNS.</b>&mdash;In the very oldest English&mdash;or, as it is
commonly called, <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>&mdash;nouns were declined in different ways,
and had several declensions, just as German and Latin have. Each of
these declensions had four cases. Nowadays we have only one declension
and only one inflection for the cases of nouns. That one inflection is
<b>’s</b> for the possessive case. The following is an example of an old
declension:</p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Declension of <b>EAGE</b>, the eye.</span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left"><i>Sing.</i></td><td align="left"><i>Plur.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Nom.</i></td><td align="left">Eage (eye).</td><td align="left">Eagan.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Pos.</i></td><td align="left">Eag-an (of).</td><td align="left">Eag-ena.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Dat.</i></td><td align="left">Eag-an (to).</td><td align="left">Eag-am.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Obj.</i></td><td align="left">Eage.</td><td align="left">Eagan.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Again, in this English, gender did not follow sex, but was poetic and
fantastic. <i>Tongue</i> and <i>week</i> were feminine nouns, as they still are in
modern German; <i>star</i> and <i>sea</i>, masculine; <i>wife</i> and <i>child</i>,
neuter.&mdash;In old English there were a great many plural endings, as <b>-as</b>,
<b>-an</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-a</b>, <b>-o</b>. After the Norman Conquest they were greatly reduced,
<b>-es</b> or <b>-s</b> being now the ordinary ending, <b>-en</b> being exceptional.</p>

<p><a name="sect-3-II" id="sect-3-II">3.</a> <b>THE GRAMMAR OF ADJECTIVES.</b>&mdash;Adjectives had also cases. Adjectives had
four cases, three genders, and two numbers. Now we say <i>good</i> for all
cases, genders, and numbers. In the fourteenth century the only ending
which adjectives possessed was <b>e</b> for the plural. Thus Chaucer
(1340-1400) writes of the little birds:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And <i>smalë</i> fowlës maken melodie.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><a name="sect-4-II" id="sect-4-II">4.</a> <b>GRAMMAR OF DEFINITE ARTICLE.</b>&mdash;This article was declined like an
adjective, in three different genders. Now it has no inflections at all.
It has still, however, a clear and distinct memory of one case, which
survives in such phrases as, ‘The more, the merrier.’ This sentence
might be written, ‘þŷ more, þŷ merrier.’ That is to say, ‘By that more,
by that merrier.’ The measure of the increase of the company is the
measure of the increase of the merriment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a>{36}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-5-II" id="sect-5-II">5.</a> <b>GRAMMAR OF THE PERSONAL PRONOUN.</b>&mdash;The personal pronoun was also
highly inflected in the oldest English; and the two personal pronouns of
the first and second persons possessed this remarkable peculiarity, that
it had three numbers, singular, dual, and plural. The dual form stood
for <i>We two</i> and for <i>You two</i>; and, if we cared to trouble ourselves
nowadays with a host of inflections, these would certainly be very
convenient.</p>

<p>All this is now very much changed. The dual number is completely gone;
the use of <i>thou</i>, except in religious compositions, has been given up,
and the true possessive of <i>it</i>, which is <b>his</b>, has given place to the
incorrect form <i>its</i>. The possessive <i>its</i> is very seldom found in
Shakspeare, and there is only one instance of it in our present
translation of the Bible: ‘That which groweth of its own accord of thy
harvest thou shalt not reap’ (Lev. xxv. 5). But another reading is, ‘of
it own accord.’</p>

<p><a name="sect-6-II" id="sect-6-II">6.</a> <b>GRAMMAR OF VERBS.</b>&mdash;The verb possessed also, in the oldest times,
before the language was at all influenced by Norman-French, a large
number of inflections. At the present time a verb has only five
inflections; but, if it belongs to the strong conjugation, it may have
six. Let us look at the old verb <i>niman</i>, to take, which still survives
in our adjective <i>nimble</i>, which means <i>quick at taking</i>.</p>

<p>The chief tenses of <b>niman</b> were inflected as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="c" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Present Tense.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"><i>Sing.</i></td><td class="c"><i>Plural.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1. nime.</td><td align="left">nimath.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2. nimest.</td><td align="left">nimath.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">3. nimeth.</td><td align="left">nimath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Past Tense.</span></td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">2. náme.</td><td align="left">námon.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">3. nám.</td><td align="left">námon.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">Of all the inflections in the above, only two still remain, <i>st</i> in the
second person singular, and <i>th</i> in the third person; and even these two
inflections are nowadays hardly used at all.</p>

<p><a name="sect-7-II" id="sect-7-II">7.</a> <b>FRAGMENTS OF NOUN INFLECTIONS.</b>&mdash;Although our language, in the course
of its history, has lost almost all of its inflections, there still
remain, here and there, in our grammar, fragments of inflections which
are often curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37"></a>{37}</span> disguised, and therefore difficult to recognise.
Thus, at first sight, it is not easy to see that <i>vixen</i> is the feminine
of <i>fox</i>. But <i>vixen</i> is simply the same as <i>fixen</i>, or <i>fyxen</i>, and it
was one of the laws of Anglo-Saxon vowel-change that <i>o</i> became <i>y</i>. It
was very usual to make the plural of nouns in <i>en</i>. Thus we said
<i>shoon</i>, <i>hosen</i>, <i>tren</i>, <i>been</i> (for <i>bees</i>), <i>toon</i> (for <i>toes</i>),
<i>flon</i> (for <i>arrows</i>), and <i>fleen</i> (for <i>fleas</i>). But, of all these and
other similar plurals, we now possess only one&mdash;<i>oxen</i>. The plurals
<i>children</i> and <i>brethren</i> are really double plurals. The oldest plurals
were <i>cildru</i>, afterwards <i>childer</i>; and <i>brether</i>. It was then
forgotten that these were real plurals, and an <i>en</i> was added.</p>

<p><a name="sect-8-II" id="sect-8-II">8.</a> <b>FRAGMENTS OF ADJECTIVE INFLECTIONS.</b>&mdash;We have the comparative <i>rather</i>
(rightly pronounced in Ireland rayther); but we have no <i>rathe</i> or
<i>rathest</i>. An old writer, speaking of a star, says: ‘It rose rather and
rather (earlier).’ <b>Nighest</b> becomes <i>next</i>; because the <b>g + s</b> is equal to
an <b>x</b>. So there was in our country an old proverb, ‘When bale is hext,
bone is next’&mdash;that is, ‘When evil is highest, boon is nighest.’ <i>Over</i>
is now only used as a preposition. But it is really the comparative
degree of the old adjective <i>ov</i>, which is a form of <i>up</i> or <i>off</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-9-II" id="sect-9-II">9.</a> <b>FRAGMENTS OF PRONOUN INFLECTIONS.</b>&mdash;The <i>t</i> in <i>it</i> (which was
formerly <i>hit</i>, as the neuter of <i>he</i>) is simply the sign of the neuter
gender, and is the same <i>t</i> that is found in <i>tha-t</i>, <i>wha-t</i> (the
neuter of <i>who</i>), etc. Hence the true possessive of <i>it</i> is <i>his</i>; and
this is the form in use in Shakspeare and Bacon, and even down to the
middle of the seventeenth century. <i>Its</i>, as we have already seen, is a
blunder. <i>They</i> is not the true plural of <i>he</i>; but really of the old
definite article <i>thaet</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-10-II" id="sect-10-II">10.</a> <b>FRAGMENTS OF VERB INFLECTIONS.</b>&mdash;The inflections of the verb are very
strangely disguised; and, if learned men had not worked hard, and made
diligent inquiry in many directions, we should never have known what
they really are. Thus the <i>m</i> in <i>am</i> is the same <i>m</i> that is found in
<i>me</i>; and the oldest form known of the verb <i>am</i>, in the oldest
language, is <i>asmi</i>.&mdash;The <i>t</i> which we find in the second person of
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38"></a>{38}</span> verbs, such as <i>art</i>, <i>wast</i>, <i>shalt</i>, and <i>wilt</i>, is the same as
the <i>th</i> in <i>thou</i>. This <i>t</i> is therefore the pronoun <i>thou</i> added to
the verb.&mdash;The <i>th</i> in the old-fashioned third person singular
<i>writeth</i>, <i>hopeth</i>, etc., is the same <i>th</i> that we find in <i>the</i> and
<i>that</i>. Accordingly, we may say that <i>burneth</i> is = <i>that</i> (<i>thing</i>)
<i>burns</i>.&mdash;The last <i>d</i> in <i>did</i> is not the same as the <i>ed</i> in <i>walked</i>.
<i>Did</i> is not = <i>doed</i>. An older form of <i>did</i> is <i>dude</i>; and from this
we see that the past tense was formed by doubling the present&mdash;by
reduplication. Thus we see that it is the last <i>d</i> that represents the
<i>do</i>.&mdash;The word <i>worth</i> in the well-known lines from the <i>Lady of the
Lake</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cost thy life, thou gallant gray!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">is not an adjective, but the remnant of an old verb. This verb is
<i>weorthan</i>, to become; and <i>worth</i> is the imperative of it. When a verb
has lost one of its parts, it goes to another verb, and borrows the use
of one of its parts. Thus <i>went</i>, the past tense of <i>go</i>, is borrowed
from <i>wend</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-11-II" id="sect-11-II">11.</a> <b>FRAGMENTS OF INFLECTIONS IN ADVERBS.</b>&mdash;Adverbs contain a great number
of disguised inflections. In the present day, we make adverbs from
adjectives by adding <i>ly</i> to them&mdash;as <i>neat</i>, <i>neatly</i>; <i>warm</i>,
<i>warmly</i>. But, in old English, the adverb was made by employing the
dative of the adjective. Thus, <i>brightë</i> was = <i>in a bright manner</i>;
<i>swiftë</i> was = <i>swiftly</i>. Then <i>ë</i> very soon dropped off; and the word
was left in its bare root&mdash;stripped of inflections. And so it has
happened that we have many adverbs which are used in their simplest
form, and are just the same as adjectives. We do not say, ‘He runs
fastly,’ but ‘He runs fast;’ ‘He works hardly,’ but ‘He works
hard.’&mdash;But the remnants of other cases are also found in adverbs. Thus
<i>needs</i>, <i>always</i>, <i>sideways</i>, <i>once</i> (for <i>onës</i>), <i>twice</i> (for
<i>twiës</i>), <i>unawares</i>, <i>whence</i> (for <i>whennës</i>) and others, are all old
possessives.&mdash;<i>Seldom</i> is an old dative plural. <i>Seld</i> meant <i>rare</i>; and
<i>seldom</i> means <i>at rare times</i>.&mdash;<i>The</i> in the phrase, ‘The older the
better,’ is an ablative or <i>instrumental</i> case; and therefore means <i>by
that</i>. Accordingly this sentence means: ‘By that older, by that
better.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39"></a>{39}</span> The measure of the increase of age is the measure of the
increase of the quality.</p>

<p><a name="sect-12-II" id="sect-12-II">12.</a> <b>FRAGMENTS OF INFLECTIONS IN PREPOSITIONS.</b>&mdash;<i>Since</i> is the possessive
case of the old English word <i>sithen</i>. The following are the steps:
<i>Sithennës</i>; <i>sithens</i>; <i>sithence</i>; <i>since</i>.&mdash;<i>After</i> is the comparative
degree of the old preposition <i>af</i> (= of), which meant <i>from</i>. <i>Over</i> is
another comparative form, from a root which appears in <i>up</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<b>Changes in Modern English.</b></h2>

<p><a name="sect-1-III" id="sect-1-III">1.</a> <b>FORMATION OF MODERN ENGLISH.</b>&mdash;We have seen that the substance of the
living English tongue was brought from Germany to this island by our
Teutonic ancestors. We have seen also that it has undergone a great
variety of influences, the greatest and strongest of which was the
Norman Conquest. For a long time after the Conquest, the English
language was the tongue of a subject and humiliated race; it ceased to
be fashionable, and almost ceased to be literary. In the thirteenth
century it began to revive, but with very important changes; the
inflections, and many of the old English words, being lost, and a
multitude of new words being introduced. In Chaucer’s time it regained
its old position as the language of the court, of fashion, and of
literature. In 1485 we find the language in all important respects fixed
as we have it now. Every intelligent Englishman is able to understand
all that has since been written.</p>

<p>Modern English, then, dates from 1485, the year when the Wars of the
Roses ended with the battle of Bosworth, and the Tudor line ascended the
throne. It was the time also when the art of printing was introduced by
Caxton; and about the time when the two great events, the Revival of
Learning and the Reformation, took place.</p>

<p><a name="sect-2-III" id="sect-2-III">2.</a> <b>CONTINUED HISTORY OF OUR LANGUAGE.</b>&mdash;It would be a mistake, however,
to suppose that the language has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a>{40}</span> no history after 1485. Language is the
expression and embodiment of thought; and as thought varies with the
varying experience of man, language must change accordingly. Since 1485
the English people have gone through marvellous changes&mdash;changes in
political and social life, in science, in art, and industry. They have
planted extensive colonies, they carry on trade in every part of the
world, and have dealings with every nation. In all this widening and
progressive life, we have got to know far more than we did in 1485, and
thus require to use a multitude of words unknown to the people of that
period. The result has been a large addition to our vocabulary.</p>

<p><a name="sect-3-III" id="sect-3-III">3.</a> <b>BORROWING FROM SPANISH AND ITALIAN.</b>&mdash;Under the heading ‘Latin of the
Fourth Period,’ we have noted the number of words borrowed from the
Latin during the sixteenth century. We are now to observe that about the
same time there was a considerable borrowing of words from the Spanish
and Italian. Of course, as Italian and Spanish are offshoots from Latin,
these words also are mostly of Latin origin.</p>

<p>(i) <b>Italian.</b>&mdash;During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Italian
literature was very extensively studied by English writers. For some
centuries the Italians were the most cultivated people in Europe. Italy
was the home of music, painting, and sculpture. Her poets served as
models to those of other nations. The earliest poets of modern England,
such as Wyatt and Surrey, were inspired by them; Spenser and Milton were
ardent students of their works. During this period, consequently, we
introduced from the Italian language many important words, among which
may be mentioned <i>sonnet</i>, <i>opera</i>, <i>cupola</i>, <i>balcony</i>, <i>palette</i>.</p>

<p>(ii) <b>Spanish.</b>&mdash;At the same time we had even more intimate relations with
Spain, though of a different kind. In the sixteenth century Spain was
the leading nation of Europe. She had the best soldiers, the first
generals and statesmen; her ships discovered America; and her kings
aimed at universal dominion. As both friend and enemy, England was
brought into close connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41"></a>{41}</span> the Spaniards. Under these
circumstances we naturally adopted many words from them. While most of
these were of Latin origin, not a few related to the new countries
discovered and conquered by Spain in America. Among the Spanish words
may be mentioned <i>buffalo</i>, <i>alligator</i>, <i>don</i>, <i>armada</i>, <i>indigo</i>,
<i>potato</i>, <i>tobacco</i>. The last two are of American origin. The rest are
Latin. <i>Alligator</i> is of Latin origin, but is the name of an American
animal.</p>

<p><a name="sect-4-III" id="sect-4-III">4.</a> <b>DUTCH WORDS.</b>&mdash;We have borrowed very few words from the Germans; but
from the people of the Netherlands, who have always been near neighbours
to us, we have derived not a few. Long ago, Flemings (or people of
Flanders) were settled in Wales and Norfolk. In the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, thousands of Protestant refugees from Antwerp and other
places in the Netherlands found an asylum in England. Since the rise of
Holland we have had many dealings, both warlike and commercial, with the
Dutch. All this accounts for the goodly number of Dutch words which we
now find in the English language, such as <i>burgomaster</i>, <i>ballast</i>,
<i>holster</i>, <i>trigger</i>, <i>yacht</i>, <i>yawl</i>.</p>

<p><a name="sect-5-III" id="sect-5-III">5.</a> It will have been clearly seen that there are two main elements in
the English language&mdash;the Teutonic element, which is by far the most
important; and the Latin element. It is interesting to trace the
relative proportion of these two elements as used by the great English
writers. In the seventeenth century, especially in such writers as
Milton and Sir Thomas Browne, we find a large use of the Latin element,
accompanied by a Latin or complex and involved structure of sentence.
Towards the end of the century, and especially in the beginning of the
eighteenth, during the period of Queen Anne, a simpler style prevailed,
the classical element being more sparingly used. But as we proceed into
the eighteenth century, the Latin part of the language is again more
largely employed by such writers as Johnson, Gibbon, and Hume; and it is
again accompanied by a more formal and elaborate structure of sentence.
But before the century closes, there is a return to simplicity and
naturalness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42"></a>{42}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-6-III" id="sect-6-III">6.</a> In the present century there are many influences specially worth
noting as affecting the language:</p>

<p>(i) <b>Social and Political Causes.</b>&mdash;Society is a complex thing,
continually growing. New facts and ideas are perpetually making
themselves felt, necessitating new words, or a more extending meaning in
old words. In this province, then, changes in language are incessantly
required. Hence the need for such new words as <i>extradition</i>,
<i>neutralisation</i>, <i>secularisation</i>; even for such unhappy coinages as
<i>burke</i>. On occasion of the great volunteer reviews of 1881, words like
<i>entrain</i> and <i>detrain</i>, applied to troops, could be noticed creeping
in. <i>Closure</i> and <i>clôture</i> were rivals for currency during the debates
of 1882; and <i>Boycott</i> began to present serious claims to permanent
citizenship in the English tongue.</p>

<p>(ii) <b>Popularising of Technical and Scientific Terms.</b>&mdash;One of the most
marked features of the nineteenth century is the great diffusion of
scientific knowledge, and the application of it to the uses of practical
life. The highest scientific results are becoming common property; and
the discoveries of science have been made to satisfy the common needs of
men. The result is that terms once unknown or exclusively technical have
gained the widest currency in the popular speech. There is no need to
mention such familiar words as <i>telegraph</i>, <i>photograph</i>, or even
<i>telephone</i> or <i>photophone</i>. The old noun <i>wire</i> has now established its
right to be used as a verb. In other spheres such terms as <i>objective</i>,
<i>subjective</i>, <i>æsthetics</i>, now fulfil important functions; <i>æsthete</i>
also seems too useful a word to be dispensed with.</p>

<p>(iii) <b>Revival of Archaisms.</b>&mdash;In many of our recent poets there has been
a tendency to revive some of the old Spenserian or Shaksperian words.
But as these are purely literary terms, with no currency in the common
speech, they need not be dwelt on.</p>

<p>(iv) <b>Introduction of Scotticisms and Americanisms.</b>&mdash;The right of the
Scottish tongue to be considered one of the worthiest varieties of the
genuine old English or Saxon tongue is now generally recognised. But
apart from that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43"></a>{43}</span> the intrinsic merit of such words as <i>eerie</i>,
<i>glamour</i>, <i>sough</i>, <i>bonnie</i>, <i>douce</i> (both of which last, however, are
of French origin), will probably secure them a permanent place in our
language. The influence of America will also be more and more felt on
the common English language, whether through its stock of old Saxon
phrases which have been preserved in America, through the innovations
made by its humorists, or the new experiences in its social and
political life.</p>

<p>(v) <b>Further borrowing from Foreign Languages.</b>&mdash;Even the most remote and
unlikely make important and familiar contributions to our tongue. From
the Malays we have (along with the thing) borrowed the words <i>bamboo</i>,
<i>gong</i>, <i>sago</i>; from the Australians we have <i>boomerang</i> and <i>kangaroo</i>;
and from South African tongues, <i>gnu</i>, <i>quagga</i>, <i>kraal</i>.</p>

<b>Notes on the Growth of English Words.</b></h2>

<p><a name="sect-1-V" id="sect-1-V">1.</a> <b>ROOTS; INFLUENCE OF IMITATION ON LANGUAGE.</b>&mdash;The question of the
origin of language is an extremely interesting one, which has been long
and keenly discussed. But it is one on which the opinions of the learned
are not agreed, and we cannot dwell upon it here. There is an
established fact, however, which is of the highest interest and
importance: most of the words of the great family of Indo-European
languages can be traced to a few hundred roots; and these roots are
common to the whole family. It is the greatest achievement of
philological science to have clearly established this fact. How these
roots have originated, is a more uncertain inquiry: in fact, is just the
question of the origin of language presented in another form. It is the
theory of some that words have arisen from the imitation of natural
sounds; the names of animals, for instance, being imitations of the
sounds they utter. Though this has been ridiculed under the nickname of
the <i>bow-wow</i> theory, there seems to be some truth in it: at anyrate no
one will deny that in the English, as in all other languages, a great
many words exist which are imitative of natural sounds. Among such words
the following may be mentioned: <i>Babble</i>, <i>boom</i>, <i>chatter</i>, <i>chirp</i>,
<i>clang</i>, <i>clatter</i>, <i>clink</i>, <i>crash</i>, <i>croak</i>, <i>cuckoo</i>, <i>fizz</i>,
<i>giggle</i>, <i>gurgle</i>, <i>hiss</i>, <i>howl</i>, <i>hum</i>, <i>hush</i>, <i>murmur</i>, <i>quack</i>,
<i>scream</i>, <i>shriek</i>, <i>squeal</i>, <i>thud</i>, <i>thump</i>, <i>thwack</i>, <i>twang</i>,
<i>whack</i>, <i>wheeze</i>, <i>whirr</i>, <i>whizz</i>.</p>

<p>Of course these words were not all originally English. <i>Clang</i> and
<i>murmur</i>, for instance, are Latin words; but they also are of imitative
origin.</p>

<p><a name="sect-2-V" id="sect-2-V">2.</a> <b>HYBRIDS.</b>&mdash;A <i>hybrid</i> is a word composed of a <i>mixture</i> of foreign and
native elements. Sometimes an English word has a Latin ending; sometimes
a Latin word has an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47"></a>{47}</span> ending. All such words are called
<i>hybrids</i>. One of the most interesting of the earliest hybrids in
English was the word <i>bondage</i>, which is said to have been introduced in
the year 1303. The word <i>bond</i> comes to us from the Icelandic or
Norwegian word <i>bondi</i>, which means <i>farmer</i> or <i>tiller of the soil</i>.
Farmers in Norway are to this day called <i>bonders</i>. The suffix <i>age</i> is
Latin; but it has come to us through Norman-French. The full Latin
ending is <i>atĭcum</i>, which, in France, in the course of generations, was
compressed into <i>age</i>. There are other hybrids with this ending, such as
<i>tillage</i> (which has pushed out the pure English <i>tilth</i>), <i>cartage</i>,
<i>stowage</i>, and others.&mdash;The ending <i>able</i>, which comes to us from Latin,
combines very easily with words which are purely English. Thus we have
<i>lovable</i>, <i>biddable</i>, <i>laughable</i>, <i>breakable</i>, and others.&mdash;The Latin
ending <i>osus</i> means <i>full of</i>. Thus, <i>vinum</i> is <i>wine</i>, and <i>vinosus</i> is
<i>full of wine</i>. This <i>ōsus</i> becomes in English <i>ous</i>; and we find this
Latin suffix added to words which are purely English. Thus we have
<i>wondrous</i> from <i>wonder</i>, and <i>ravenous</i> from <i>raven</i>. We have also
<i>righteous</i>, which was originally <i>rightwîs</i>, and the change into
<i>righteous</i> was a corruption of the spelling.&mdash;<i>Dis</i> is a Latin prefix,
and it is added to English words. Thus we have <i>dislike</i> and <i>disown</i>.
We have also <i>dishearten</i>, an old word, in which the prefix <i>dis</i>
contradicts the suffix <i>en</i> (which means to <i>put</i> or <i>make</i>).&mdash;<i>Re</i>,
another Latin prefix, unites with purely English words, and we find
<i>renew</i>, <i>reopen</i>, <i>rebuild</i>, <i>reclothe</i>, and others.&mdash;French words with
English prefixes are also found. Thus we have <i>besiege</i>; the word
<i>siege</i>, a <i>seat</i>, being French. <i>To besiege</i> means to take a seat in
front of a town, with your mind made up not to go till you have taken
it.&mdash;Latin words with English endings are found in <i>useful</i>, <i>useless</i>,
<i>usefulness</i>, <i>uselessness</i>, and others. English words with Latin or
French endings are not uncommon. Thus we have <i>goddess</i>, <i>forbearance</i>,
<i>hindrance</i>, <i>oddity</i>, and others. In old-fashioned English, and even in
Wordsworth, who died in 1850, we find such curious formations as
<i>oddments</i>, <i>needments</i>, <i>eggments</i> (<i>eggings on</i> or <i>incitements</i>), and
a few others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48"></a>{48}</span></p>

<b>Outline of Our Early Literature</b></h3>

<p class="c">(WITH ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE EARLY LANGUAGE).</p>

<p><a name="sect-1-LIT" id="sect-1-LIT">1.</a> <b>THE BEOWULF.</b>&mdash;The <i>Beowulf</i> is a poem which recounts the life and
death of a hero of that name, who slays a monster called <i>Grendel</i>. It
was a poetic legend brought from the Continent by our Teutonic
ancestors. It does not seem to have been written down, or committed to
paper, till the seventh century; and it was probably preserved in the
memory of different generations, by its being taught by fathers to their
sons, and by the habit of chanting portions of it at the banquets of
kings and warriors. It is a poem which in substance belongs to the
Continental Teutons as much as to the English; and it marks the point at
which their literatures and languages begin to branch off. The scene is
laid in the north of Denmark; so that the poem is Northern, and not
Southern, Teutonic. Its present form is due to a Christian writer of
Northumbria. In literary form, therefore, it is English; and is one of
the earliest monuments of our literature. The poem consists of 6350
short lines, and is written throughout in head-rhymes,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or
alliterative rhymes.</p>

<p><a name="sect-2-LIT" id="sect-2-LIT">2.</a> <b>CÆDMON.</b>&mdash;But the first true English poem was the work of a
Northumbrian called <span class="smcap">Cædmon</span>, who was a servant to the monks of the abbey
of Hilda, in Whitby. It was written about the year 670. It is a
paraphrase of the history given in the Old and the New Testament. It
sings of the creation of the world, of the history of Israel, of the
life of Christ, of death, judgment, purgatory, heaven, and hell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77"></a>{77}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-3-LIT" id="sect-3-LIT">3.</a> <b>BÆDA.</b>&mdash;The oldest literature of a nation&mdash;the early writings of its
childhood&mdash;are always poetic; and prose-writings do not appear until the
nation has, as it were, grown up. The first English prose-writer was
<span class="smcap">Bæda</span>&mdash;or, as he is generally called, The Venerable Bede. He was born in
the year 673. Like Cædmon, our first poet, he was a Northumbrian, and
belonged to the monastery of Jarrow-upon-Tyne. His most important
writings were in Latin; and the best known of them is an <i>Ecclesiastical
History of the English People</i>. But the work which makes Bæda our first
writer of English prose, is a translation into English of the <i>Gospel of
St John</i>. It was his last work; and, in fact, he died just after he had
dictated the last sentence. This was in the year 735.</p>

<p><a name="sect-4-LIT" id="sect-4-LIT">4.</a> <b>KING ALFRED.</b>&mdash;Up to the year 866, Northumbria was the home of
learning and literature; and the Northumbrian monks were its loving and
diligent cultivators. But the incursions of the Danes, the destruction
of the monasteries, and the perpetual danger to life and property
arising from the troubled condition of the country, put a stop for some
time to study and to letters. The cultivation of English as a
book-language reappears, towards the end of the ninth century, in the
south of the island. Alfred the Great, king of Wessex, is its great
friend and promoter. Winchester was the capital of his kingdom; and it
was at Winchester that Alfred and his colleagues laboured at the writing
of English books. He invited great scholars from different parts of the
world; he set up schools; he himself taught a school in his own court;
he translated the Latin manuals of the time into English, and added
largely to them from his own materials; he translated also the <i>History</i>
of the Venerable Bede; and, most probably, he worked at the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>, and made it much fuller and more detailed than it had ever
been before. He founded schools in the different parts of his kingdom,
with the purpose and in the hope that ‘every free-born youth, who has
the means, may attend to his book till he can read English writing
perfectly.’ Alfred was born in the year 849, and died in 901. His own
personal diligence&mdash;his unceasing head-work, are well known. He gave
eight hours a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a>{78}</span> day to the work of public affairs&mdash;of managing the
business of his kingdom; eight hours to books and study; and he reserved
only eight hours for sleep, meals, exercise, and amusement. The
following is a passage from one of King Alfred’s writings:</p>

<p><a name="sect-5-LIT" id="sect-5-LIT">5.</a> <b>THE ANGLO-SAXON CHRONICLE.</b>&mdash;This chronicle was written chiefly by
monks, and was, in its earliest forms, a dry register or record of
events&mdash;of the births and deaths of kings, bishops, earls, and other
distinguished persons. In Alfred’s time, it became more of a history;
and even war-songs and battle odes are quoted in it. It was continued
down to the death of King Stephen in 1154; and the last portions of it
were composed and transcribed by the monks of Peterborough.</p>

<p><a name="sect-6-LIT" id="sect-6-LIT">6.</a> <b>ARCHBISHOP ÆLFRIC.</b>&mdash;Ælfric was Archbishop of Canterbury in the early
part of the eleventh century; and he translated the first seven books of
the Bible, and part of Job, into the oldest form of English, which is
generally called <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>. The following is a specimen:</p>

<p><a name="sect-7-LIT" id="sect-7-LIT">7.</a> <b>ANGLO-SAXON GOSPELS.</b>&mdash;This translation of the four gospels forms
another land-mark in the history of our English tongue. This translation
was made before the Norman Conquest&mdash;before French words had come into
our<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79"></a>{79}</span> language, and therefore before the inflections of English had
dropped off from the words.</p>

<p><a name="sect-8-LIT" id="sect-8-LIT">8.</a> <b>OLD ENGLISH DIALECTS.</b>&mdash;For more than a century after the Conquest,
English ceased to be used as a literary language&mdash;as a book-speech,
except in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, which was continued down to 1154. It
still continued, of course, to be the language of the English nation.
The Normans, when they used books at all, imported French books from
France; and they never dreamed that English was a language worthy to be
written down. Different English counties spoke different kinds of
English; and this continued for many centuries&mdash;and still continues to a
considerable extent. Thus the English spoken by a Yorkshire-man is very
different from the English spoken by a Dorsetshire-man; and the English
of both differs very much from that spoken in Kent. But, in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries&mdash;and even much later&mdash;travelling was very
difficult and expensive; working-men could not travel at all; there was
little motive to travel for any one; and generations were born and died
within the same village, or on one farm, or at least in one part of the
‘country-side.’ Thus different parts of this island pronounced their
English in their own way; had their own grammar&mdash;that is, their own
inflections; and each division of England looked upon itself as the
right and correct speakers of the English tongue. But, among the large
number of different dialects, there gradually emerged into distinct and
even remarkable prominence three chief dialects. These are now known as
the <b>Northern</b>, <b>Midland</b>, and <b>Southern</b>. The grammar of the three differs in
several respects; but the chief grammatical mark is found in the plural
ending of the present tense of verbs. This is <b>ës</b> in the North; <b>en</b> in the
Midland dialect; and <b>eth</b> in the South. Thus we have:</p>

<p><a name="sect-9-LIT" id="sect-9-LIT">9.</a> <b>THE FIRST ENGLISH BOOK AFTER THE NORMAN CONQUEST.</b>&mdash;Normandy was lost
to England in the reign of King John, in the year 1204. From that date,
as we have seen, there was a compulsion on the Norman-French to forget
their foreign origin, and to look upon themselves as genuine Englishmen.
A year after, in the year 1205, ten years before the winning of the
Magna Charta, appeared the first work&mdash;it was a poem&mdash;that was written
in English after the Conquest. It is a translation by a Somersetshire
priest called <b>Layamon</b> or <b>Laweman</b>, from a French poem. <i>Brut</i> is the
French form of the name <i>Brutus</i>, who was said to be a son of Æneas, and
to be the founder of the British nation. In those rude times, when
history was quite unknown, the origin of every nation was traced up to
Troy, and the persons of the <i>Iliad</i> of Homer. The <i>Brut</i> is a poem
written chiefly in head-rhymes, and consists of about thirty thousand
lines. But though it is translated from a French poem, there are not
fifty French words in the whole&mdash;that is, there is not one French word
in every six hundred lines.</p>

<p><a name="sect-10-LIT" id="sect-10-LIT">10.</a> <b>ORM’S ORMULUM, 1215.</b>&mdash;The <i>Ormulum</i> was a poem written by an
Augustine monk, called <b>Orm</b> or <b>Ormin</b>, and called after his own name. It
is a poem of nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a>{81}</span> twenty thousand short lines, without rhyme of any
kind&mdash;but with a regular number of accents. There are not five French
words in the whole poem. Orm was extremely particular about his
spelling; and, when an accent struck a consonant after a <i>short</i> vowel,
he insisted on doubling the consonant.</p>

<p><a name="sect-11-LIT" id="sect-11-LIT">11.</a> <b>LANGLAND AND CHAUCER.</b>&mdash;William Langland represents the part of the
nation that spoke pure English; Geoffrey Chaucer, that part which spoke
English with a large admixture of Norman-French. In fact, Chaucer’s
poems show the high-water mark of the French saturation of our English
vocabulary. Langland&mdash;a west-countryman, a monk, a man of the people,
and of intensely radical sympathies&mdash;was born in 1332; Chaucer, a
Londoner, in the very centre of English society, page to the Duchess of
Clarence at sixteen years of age, and afterwards for great part of his
life in court employment, was born in 1340. Both died in the year 1400.
Langland’s most important poem is the <i>Vision of (concerning) Piers
Plowman</i>. It is written in pure English, and in head-rhyme. It is the
last English poem that was written in this kind of alliterative verse.

<p>Chaucer’s great work is his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, a series of tales
supposed to be told by a company of pilgrims to beguile their journey to
the shrine of St Thomas of Canterbury. The company represented men and
women of almost every class in England; and their manners and character
are painted with wonderful truth and beauty. The following is a passage

<p>In Old English or Anglo-Saxon poetry it was the only kind of rhyme used.
The rhyme which is called end-rhyme was not known to the Saxons, and was
imported into England by the Normans. In the ordinary Old English verse,
the lines are written in pairs, and in each pair there are usually three
alliterations, two in the first line and one in the second. Even as late
as the fourteenth century we find such verses as the following, written

<p>Shakspeare is fond of making fun of it. But it has unconsciously
survived in the language; and there is not a single great English poet,
from Shakspeare to Tennyson, who does not make a large use of it. Thus
Shakspeare himself has</p>

<p class="nind">and many other similar lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a>{83}</span></p>

<span class="i0">Our sweetest songs are those which tell of saddest thought.<br /></span>

of Kent. The date of his birth is not known; but he survived Chaucer
eight years, dying in 1408. He wrote the <i>Lover’s Confession</i> in English
verse; the <i>Mirror of the Meditative Man</i> in French verse (lost); the
<i>Voice of one crying</i>, in Latin. His style was heavy and prosaic.
Chaucer called him the ‘moral Gower.’</p>

<p><a name="sect-14-LIT" id="sect-14-LIT">14.</a> <b>JOHN BARBOUR.</b>&mdash;Another eminent contemporary of Chaucer was John
Barbour, Archdeacon of Aberdeen, who wrote in the Scottish, or Northern
English, form of our tongue. He was a learned man, and a man of the
world, who filled important office in the employment of the Scottish
king. His great work was a narrative poem, <i>The Bruce</i>, giving an
account of the life and adventures of the great Bruce. It is valuable
both as a monument of our language and a storehouse of historical
incident. Barbour died about 1395. The literature of Scotland was
worthily continued by the royal poet, James I. (1394-1437), brought up
as a prisoner in England, and well educated. His great work was the
<i>King’s Quhair</i> (or book), a poem in the style and in one of the metres
of Chaucer.</p>

<p><a name="sect-15-LIT" id="sect-15-LIT">15.</a> <b>SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE.</b>&mdash;Sir John Mandeville is the first writer of the
<i>new</i> English prose&mdash;the prose with a large addition of French words. He
is sometimes called the Father of English Prose. He was born at St
Albans, in Hertfordshire, in 1300, and died at Liège, in 1372. He was a
great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84"></a>{84}</span> traveller, soldier, and physician; travelled through the Holy
Land, served under the Sultan of Egypt and the Great Khan of Cathay (the
old name for <i>China</i>); and wandered through almost all the then known
parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. He wrote his travels in three
languages&mdash;first in Latin for the learned; then in French for the
Norman-French; and lastly in English, ‘that every man of the nation
might understand them.’ The following is a specimen of his prose:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And 2 myle from Ebron (Hebron) is the grave of Lothe (Lot) that was
Abrahames brother. And a lytille fro Ebron is the mount of Mambre,
of the whiche the valeye takethe his name. And there is a tree of
oke, that the Sarazinis clepen (call) <i>Dirpë</i>, that is of Abrahames
tyme, the whiche men clepen the drye tree. And thei saye, that it
hathe ben there sithe the beginnynge of the world, and was sumtyme
grene, and bare leves, unto the tyme that oure Lord dyede on the
cros; and thanne it dryede, and so dyden alle the trees, that weren
thanne in the world.</p></div>

<p>This is almost quite like modern English&mdash;with the exception of the
spelling;</p>

<p><a name="sect-16-LIT" id="sect-16-LIT">16.</a> <b>JOHN WICLIFFE.</b>&mdash;John Wicliffe,* or John de Wycliffe, was born at the
village of Hipswell, near Richmond, in Yorkshire, in the year 1324. He
died at the vicarage of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, in the year
1384, at the age of sixty. He was the first Englishman who attempted to
make a complete translation of the Scriptures. Of this work, however,
the Gospels alone can be certainly identified as the work of Wicliffe
himself. The Old Testament and apocryphal books were translated
principally by Nicolas de Hereford, and it is supposed that his work was
interrupted in 1382, and that the Bible was completed about that time by
extracting the text of the gospels from Wicliffe’s commentary on the
gospels (written in 1360), and adding to it a new translation of the
rest of the New Testament. A later version was finished by Wicliffe’s
friend, John Purvey, about 1388, and appears to be mainly a revision of
the work of Hereford and Wicliffe. The later is a less close and literal
version than the former, and is expressed in more idiomatic and less
laboured English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a>{85}</span></p>

<p><a name="sect-17-LIT" id="sect-17-LIT">17.</a> <b>OUR ENGLISH BIBLE AND ITS HISTORY.</b>&mdash;The first fresh translation from
the original sources was that of <b>William Tyndale</b>. His New Testament,
printed at Cologne and at Worms, reached the English shores in 1526, and
was followed three years later by the Pentateuch. To this translation
our authorised version owes much of its peculiar force and beauty. The
first complete English Bible was that of <b>Miles Coverdale</b>, which appeared
in 1535. In April 1539 appeared the <b>Great Bible</b> (so called from its
large size), prepared by Coverdale at Paris, but completed in London
under the patronage of Thomas Cromwell. The translation of the psalms in
the Great Bible has remained, without alteration, the Psalter in the
Book of Common Prayer. During the last year of Mary’s reign and the
beginning of Elizabeth’s, the English refugees at Geneva completed a
fresh revision of the Great Bible, which was published in 1560, in a
handy size, with a marginal commentary, and the chapters divided into
verses. The <b>Genevan version</b> (sometimes called the Breeches Bible),
became popular with the Puritans, and more than two hundred editions of
it were published, and it gave way slowly before the present authorised
version. Soon after Elizabeth’s accession, Archbishop Parker organised a
revision of the Great Bible of 1539, which was published in 1568, and
became known as the <b>Bishops’ Bible</b>. During Elizabeth’s reign, the Popish
exiles at Rheims produced a new version from the Vulgate, which was
printed at Douay in 1609, and is known as the <b>Douay Bible</b>. The English
Bible which is now recognised as the ‘<b>authorised version</b>’ wherever the
English language is spoken, is a revision of the Bishops’ Bible, begun
in 1604 and finished in 1611. Of this noble version many millions have
been printed, and its general acceptance by all English-speaking people
is the best testimony to its excellence. No book has had so great an
influence on our language and literature; its words and phrases have
been preserved in our vocabulary, and are the most familiar to our ears,
consecrated as they are with the associations of two hundred and seventy
years. A revision of our version by the most eminent scholars is now in
progress, and the revised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a>{86}</span> New Testament was published, May 17, 1881.
Appended is a passage from Romans (xii. 6-8), as it appears in
Wicliffe’s, Tyndale’s, the Great Bible, the Genevan Bible, the Bishop’s
Bible, and our Authorised Version:</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
